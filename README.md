# PHYS200

This repository contains the projects that I've made as a part of the PHYS200-Basics of Scientific Computation class during 2022-2023 Spring semester.

# Description of Projects

GuidingCenter: Animation of the guiding center motion for an electron in plasma.

PiMonteCarlo: Approximation of pi by placing random points in an 1x1 square & deciding which ones are in and out of the quarter circle in that square. Ratio of points in and out is to the ratio of areas (circle and square), hence pi is computed.

RandomWalk2D: 2D randomwalk algorithm in which average & rms values of each number of walks (K) is computed. As it is seen from the graphs, average distance converges to square root of number of steps (N) which is the most likely path.

SmoothData: Calculation of moving average for N neighboring points, resulting in a smoothed plot of a noisy data.
